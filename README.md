# aethon-arion-c1

## Description

This package defines the data pipeline classes and interfaces used by the Arion C1 model over the generic Arion data pipeline, as specified on the project's [homepage](https://arion.aethon.sg/our-tools/aethon-arion-C1/).  The classes implement the DTOs and other classes used by the simulation nodes and server of our implementation of the model described on the Arion [framework pages](https://arion.aethon.sg/our-framework/).

In order to work with the Arion data pipeline spanning the simulation node, server and analysis client, all Arion organisation models must be based on this package and implement the required abstract methods of the Board, Organisation, Plant, Reporting State and Simulation classes.
